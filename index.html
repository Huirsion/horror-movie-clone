      <h1>BEST HORROR SCENES</h1>
      <h5>
        An ever growing collection featuring some of the best scenes in horror.
      </h5>
      <p>
        “Best Horror Scenes” is a collection of scenes I feel are some of the
        most affecting in horror. Some may be simple black cat scares, others
        may be more subdued or nuanced. Many come from films that aren't
        necessarily “horror” but have elements or threads of horror, and all
        have the same general effect: unease, dread, fear, shock, disgust.

        Best Horror Scenes is a love letter to the Horror film genre by Brandon
        Durham. Most film clips contain major spoilers, and it is recommended
        you don’t watch the clip if you plan on seeing the film.

      <h1>They Look Like People (2015)</h1>
      <h5>Directed by Perry Blackshear</h5>
      <p>
        This one’s another one for the completist horror fan. It’s not a bad
        film by any means. It’s actually pretty great, and quite terrifying.
        It’s just… very bleak, with nothing much to wash it down with. Director
        Pascal Laugier has gotten a lot of guff for this film over the years,
        including from the two lead actresses. He even went so far as to open
        the DVD presentation of Martyrs with an apology to its viewers. Laugier
        wants you to know that he’s sorry for what he has committed to film. He
        shouldn’t be sorry. He created what’s become an important film in the
        New French Extremity movement, and those are some great films to be
        associated with.
